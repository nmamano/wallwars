      This is the lobby. From here, you can create games that your friends can
      join, or join a friend's game.
    </h6>
    <h6>
      When you create a game, you can choose the <em>duration</em> (per player)
      and a time <em>increment</em> that is added to each player after they
      move, among other settings. Once you create a game, a <em>join code</em>{" "}
      will appear at the top. Share this code with your friend to play with
      them. In addition, if you select the "Public" game option, anyone will be
      able to see and join your game.
    </h6>
    <h6>
      You can find public games to join in the <em>Open Challenges</em> tab in
      the lobby. To join a private game from a friend, write the code they give
      you in the box next to the <em>Join Game</em> button and click it.

      To get a feel for the game, you can watch some of the recent games listed
      in the <em>Recente Games</em> tab in the lobby.

      Wallwars is an online 2-player strategy board game. The player who gets to
      their goal first wins. You can place walls to reshape the terrain to your
      advantage.
    </h6>
    <h6>
      WallWars is inspired by board games like Blockade and Quoridor. The main
      difference is that in WallWars there is no limit to how many walls you can
      place, and moves are more flexible (for instance, you can move and place a
      wall in the same turn).
